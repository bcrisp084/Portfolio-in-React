## Installation

If for some reason you want to fork this repo you can do so if you please although i think you may want to change a few things to make it your own. If you do download it make sure you install all the dependencies with npm install. Than you can run npm start to get the application running.

## Description

In this profile i have included a little bit of info about myself as well as all the contact information to get in touch with me. There is a projects page that demonstrates some of the applications i have built up until this point. The portfolio will continue to grow in size and design as i continue on my path.
